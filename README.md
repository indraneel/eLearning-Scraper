Scraper/Leaderboard â€” eLearning for Change
==========================================
This is my first thing I've made that's sorta cool. Don't spit your coffee out too hard when reading my code, I can't vouch for consistency/quality.

What I did
----------
I used Python (which I hadn't ever used prior to this project) and its awesome libraries (PyCurl & BeautifulSoup) to get the content from a horribly designed (they serve up HTML through jQuery/AJAX) voting site, Offerpop, to create a better leaderboard for my friend to look at it and use to gauge his project's performance.

It also doesn't automatically reload the data. That's coming soon.
